To set up Minikube on Amazon Linux, you’ll need to follow a series of steps that include installing dependencies, downloading Minikube, and configuring it for use with your hypervisor. Here’s how you can do it:

Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up Minikube on Amazon Linux
1. Update your system
First, update the Amazon Linux package manager:
sudo yum update -y
2. Install Docker
Minikube uses Docker as the default container runtime, so you’ll need to install and start Docker.

Install Docker:

sudo yum install docker -y
Start Docker service:

sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Add your user to the Docker group (optional, to avoid needing sudo for Docker commands):

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Logout and log back in to apply the group membership.

3. Install Kubectl
Kubectl is the command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

Download the latest version of kubectl:

curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/$(curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
Make it executable:
chmod +x ./kubectl
Move it to your PATH:

sudo mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
Test the installation:

kubectl version --client
4. Install Minikube
Now, install Minikube by downloading the binary and setting it up:

Download Minikube:
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
Make it executable:

chmod +x minikube
Move it to your PATH:
sudo mv minikube /usr/local/bin/
Verify the installation:
minikube version
5. Start Minikube
Start Minikube with the docker driver (the default):

minikube start --driver=docker
This command will download the Kubernetes components and start Minikube.

6. Verify Minikube Setup
Once Minikube has started successfully, you can verify it by running:

minikube status
Also, test your Kubernetes cluster by running:

kubectl get nodes
